# üì∏ Computer Vision Projects Repository

Welcome to the **Computer Vision** repository! This repo serves as a central place to store and explore various computer vision projects, experiments, and research implementations.

## üìö Overview of Computer Vision

**Computer Vision (CV)** is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world, such as images and videos. It plays a critical role in applications ranging from autonomous vehicles and healthcare diagnostics to manufacturing, retail, and augmented reality.

Computer Vision tasks are generally categorized into the following major domains:

---

### 1. üß† Image Classification
- **Definition**: Predicting a single or multiple labels for the entire image.
- **Examples**:
  - Handwritten digit recognition (e.g., MNIST)
  - Animal/bird species classification
  - Scene or environment tagging
- **Subtasks**:
  - *Multi-label classification* (Image Tagging)
  - *Attribute prediction* (e.g., gender, age, emotion recognition)

---

### 2. üéØ Object Detection
- **Definition**: Identifying and localizing multiple objects within an image using bounding boxes.
- **Popular algorithms**: YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN
- **Applications**:
  - Traffic and pedestrian detection
  - Industrial quality control
  - Retail product recognition

---

### 3. üß© Image Segmentation
- **Definition**: Dividing an image into meaningful parts or segments at the pixel level.
- **Types**:
  - *Semantic Segmentation*: Assigning a class to each pixel (e.g., sky, road, car).
  - *Instance Segmentation*: Distinguishing between different instances of the same object.
  - *Panoptic Segmentation*: A combination of both semantic and instance segmentation.

## üîç Other Notable Computer Vision Tasks
- **Pose Estimation**: Detecting human or object keypoints and skeletal structure.
- **Object Tracking**: Following objects across frames in video sequences.
- **Facial Recognition**: Identifying or verifying a person from a digital image.
- **Image Generation**: Creating realistic or synthetic images using GANs or diffusion models.
- **Image Restoration**: Enhancing or repairing degraded images (e.g., denoising, inpainting).
- **Visual Summarization**: Generating high-level summaries or captions from images/videos.
- **Image Anomaly Detection**: Identifying unusual or rare patterns in visual data.
